# Example 1: Function completion
# Copilot can suggest the implementation of recursive functions
def calculate_factorial(n):
    # Ghost text will suggest the factorial implementation


# Example 2: Pattern recognition
# Copilot recognizes mathematical sequences
sequence = [1, 3, 9, 27]
# Ghost text will suggest the next numbers in the geometric sequence


# Example 3: String manipulation
def format_name(full_name):
    # Ghost text will suggest name formatting logic
    # e.g., "john doe" -> "John Doe"


# Example 4: Array transformation
temperatures = [-5, 0, 15, 25, 30]
# Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit using list comprehension
# Ghost text will suggest the conversion formula


# Example 5: Class implementation
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):
        self.account_number = account_number
        self.balance = balance
    
    def 
    # Ghost text will suggest common banking methods like deposit, withdraw, get_balance


# Example 6: Database connection handling
def connect_to_database(host, port):
    # Ghost text will suggest typical database connection code


# Example 7: Input validation
# Create a pattern to validate phone numbers
phone_pattern = 


# Example 8: Object manipulation
product = {
    "id": "ABC123",
    "price": 29.99,
    "stock": 100,
    "category": "electronics"
}
# Ghost text will suggest common object operations


# Example 9: CSV file processing
def analyze_sales_data(csv_file):
    # Ghost text will suggest CSV reading and analysis code


# Example 10: Data sorting and filtering
products = [
    {"name": "Laptop", "price": 999, "rating": 4.5},
    {"name": "Phone", "price": 599, "rating": 4.8},
    {"name": "Tablet", "price": 299, "rating": 4.2}
]
# Filter products by price and sort by rating
# Ghost text will suggest filtering and sorting logic
